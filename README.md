CS260D_Project_Final.ipynb is the project notebook containing all output for model evaluations. This includes metric collection mentioned in the project report, including per-class test accuracy and number of classes above 0 test accuracy. 

The directory CS260_Project_Files includes all .pkl files generated during the project, containing indices for training points contained in SAS and Random subsets. It also includes all .pth files for models trained during the project.

I removed the saved datasets from the repo since they were too large to write to Github, so CS260_Project_Files/Datasets will be empty. Uncommenting and running the first 3 blocks of section 2 in the notebook should download and save train/test datasets to the appropriate directory. 

The final project report PDF has also been uploaded.
